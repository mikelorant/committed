## üí° Highlights [‚≠°](#committed)

- Built-in **multiline editor** with rich capabilities.
- Custom **emoji selector** providing popular sets to choose from.
- **Switch author** before applying the commit.
- Inline **text interface** mimics the Git log output.
- Dynamic **subject line counter**.
- Toggle appending **sign-off** required by many open source projects.
- Automatically **hard wraps** body to 72 characters.
- Best practise **recommendations**.
- Import and **amend** previous commit.
- **Adaptive colours** with **light** and **dark** themes.

## üêæ First Steps [‚≠°](#committed)

1. Install using Homebrew.

   ```shell
   brew install mikelorant/committed/committed
   ```

2. Before creating and applying a commit you will need to stage the files you
   wish to add with the `git add` command.

3. Committed replaces the `git commit` command and all you need to do to commit
   your change is to run:

   ```shell
   committed
   ```

   It is also possible to amend your previous commit with:

   ```shell
   committed --amend
   ```

Once the UI has appeared take note of the keyboard shortcuts shown at the bottom
of the interface.

```text
 Alt + <enter> Commit <s> Sign-off </> Help                Summary <tab>
Ctrl +     <c> Cancel                                       Author <tab> + Shift
```

These shortcuts will help you apply or cancel a commit and navigate between the
different components. Pressing enter on most components will automatically
switch you to the next one.

## üí¨ Purpose [‚≠°](#committed)

The benefits of high quality commits are well documented however the tooling to
follow these practises has been lacking. In most cases you are either providing
a single line commit message or forced into a full screen editor which has no
knowledge of recommended Git practises.

It is common to accidentally commit to the wrong branch or use the incorrect
author name. Improving clarity of commits with emojis or detailed messages is
often frustrating.

For many, knowing what makes a good commit is not even thought about.

Committed attempts to solve these problems by first educating on best practises.
It then helps guide and enforce these de factor standards while showing how the
commit will end up being displayed to other users.

The interface does not take over the sceen or force switching to another
application. All actions are done with the keyboard which is consistent with the
Git command which is often used before the actual commit. Having an editor which
allows for more advanced cursor movement and editing assists with revising
rather than accepting what has already been written.

These capabilities all contribute to helping create a commit message that is
useful.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations [‚≠°](#committed)

### Option Key

The option key needs to be set to send the `meta` or `esc+` keycode. Terminals
such as macOS Terminal or iTerm2 may not have this as default. If not set
correctly it will not be possible to apply a commit.

To make these changes following the instructions below.

| Terminal       | Setting                                               |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS Terminal | `Profiles` `Keyboard`<br />![macOS Terminal options]  |
| iTerm2         | `Preferences` `Profile` `Keys`<br />![iTerm2 options] |

The alternative keyboard shortcut <kbd>‚å• Option</kbd> + <kbd>\\</kbd> can also
be used to apply a commit.

[macos terminal options]: docs/keyboard-options-macos-terminal.png
[iterm2 options]: docs/keyboard-options-iterm2.png

### Rendering Borders

Terminals render emojis differently and this makes alignment of borders
complicated and difficult. It is an ongoing process to improve the compatibility
with terminals. The following list are the terminals that have been tested.
Other terminals may display correctly and feedback would be appreciated to help
update the list.

| Terminal                   | Status         | Compatibility Mode |
| :------------------------- | :------------- | :----------------- |
| macOS Terminal[¬π](#iTerm2) | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 9          |
| iTerm2                     | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 14         |
| Visual Studio Code         | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 9          |
| Hyper                      | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 9          |
| Alacritty                  | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 9          |
| WezTerm[¬≤](#WezTerm)       | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 9          |
| ttyd                       | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 9          |
| kitty                      | ![‚úÖ][confirm] | Unicode 14         |

#### iTerm2

iTerm2 versions lower than `3.5.0` will need to use Unicode 9 compatibility.

It is also important to make sure that options related to [variation selector 16][iterm2 vs16]
use full width when using Unicode 14 compatibility. This requires setting
`Support variation selector 16 making emoji fullwidth outside of alternate
screen mode?` to `Yes`.

To correctly align emojis using variation select 16 within `git log`, the
setting `Support variation selector 16 making emoji fullwidth in all modes?`
must be set to `Yes`.

[iterm2 vs16]: https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/issues/10480

#### WezTerm

WezTerm has [configurable][wezterm unicode] Unicode version support. This
currently defaults to Unicode 9.

## üèÜ Best Practises [‚≠°](#committed)

To create a well formed commit, these are some of the best practises that are
often cited.

> Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
>
> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
> characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
> subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
> line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
> the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
> two together.
>
> Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
> or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
> by commands like git merge and git revert.
>
> Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
>
> - Bullet points are okay, too
>
> - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
>   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
>
> - Use a hanging indent

## üìö Tips [‚≠°](#committed)

### Aliases

Shell or Git aliases can be used to tailor Committed to your preferred workflow.
An example Git alias is as follows:

```shell
git config --global alias.co '! committed'
```

You can then commit changes with:

```shell
git co
```

### Prepare Message Hook

Committed can be installed as a Git prepare message hook. Be aware that any
existing `prepare-commit-msg` hook will not be replaced and it is necessary to
remove this hook before installing.

Installation:

```shell
committed hook --install
```

Removal:

```shell
committed hook --uninstall
```

### Editor

Committed can replace the default Git editor which allows commits to be applied
using `git commit`. Most of the standard Git command arguments can be used.

```shell
git config --global core.editor "committed --editor"
```

This can be removed with:

```shell
git config --global --unset-all core.editor
```

There are some limitations related to acting as an editor.

- Comment lines will be truncated to the width of the editor.
- Interactive rebasing and other operations which require edit commands may have
  visual issues. The first command may be part of the summary.
- Author cannot be set. The configured Git author will be used and will be
  selected using the default Git method (repository followed by global).
- When amending, subject line may be part of the body.
- When amending, emoji character or shortcode must be in the existing data set.
- When amending, summary will be truncated if more than 72 characters.
- When amending, trailers will be imported into the body.

### Amend

There are certain limitations when amending commits and it is recommended only
for use with commits created with Committed. The limitations share similarities
with using Git as an editor.

- Emoji character or shortcode must be in the existing data set.
- Trailers will be imported into the body.
- Summary will be truncated if more than 72 characters.
- Lines will not reflow when editing the body.
